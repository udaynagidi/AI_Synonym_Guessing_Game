# AI Synonym Guessing Game – NLP with Python

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents a fun and educational *synonym guessing game* developed in Python using NLP libraries.  
The game challenges users to guess synonyms of a given word based on similarity scores calculated using vector models or embedding-based techniques.  
It’s an engaging way to explore *word similarity, **text preprocessing, and **user interaction* in Natural Language Processing.

## 📊 Dataset Description
The game leverages:
- A *predefined word bank* or vocabulary list
- *Pretrained embeddings* (optional, e.g., spaCy, GloVe, Word2Vec)
- Internal scoring to compute semantic similarity

No external dataset is required, but the notebook can be extended to use external corpora or dictionaries for enrichment.

---

## 📈 Visualizations Used
- *Bar charts*: Similarity scores of guesses vs. the target word
- *Progress plot*: Accuracy or attempts tracking (if implemented)
- *Word similarity heatmaps* (optional if expanded)

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Semantic similarity can be computed using vector-based models to create interactive language applications.
- Cosine similarity is an effective measure for comparing word embeddings.
- NLP can be used for not only analysis, but also *game development* and *language learning*.
